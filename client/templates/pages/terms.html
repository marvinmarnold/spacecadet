via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active SpaceCadet Account.
You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration
process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. SpaceCadet
reserves the right to suspend or terminate your SpaceCadet Account and your access to the
Site, App and Services if you create more than one (1) SpaceCadet Account or if any information

It is Landlord’s sole right to check the Renter's background, credit history and/or criminal
history and refuse to rent to Renter, or terminate Renter's booking of the Landlord's Space, as
the case may be, upon receipt of such information. SpaceCadet does not perform such
background, criminal history or credit checks, and you hereby release and hold SpaceCadet
harmless from any and all liability resulting from Landlord’s performance or failure to perform,
such checks, or from Landlords actions upon receiving background information on Renter.
3. CHANGE OF RENTER INFORMATION
Renter agrees to immediately notify Landlord of changes in Renter's email address, mailing
address, phone number or other information. A change of address will not be effective unless
the new address is complete and the notice is in writing, signed, and dated by Renter and
actually received by Landlord. Return addresses on envelopes, forwarding orders or addresses
on checks are insufficient.
Notice of a change of Renter’s or Landlord’s phone numbers may be made orally or in writing.
Renter is strongly encouraged to keep Landlord informed of any anticipated changes that may
affect the terms of storage.
V. LISTINGS
1. STORAGE LISTINGS
As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions
about the Space to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features,
availability of the Space and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be
featured in Listings via the Site, App and Services, all Space must have valid physical addresses.
Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, App, and Services. Other Members will be
able to book your Space via the Site, App and Services based upon the information provided in
your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Renter requests a booking of your Space,
the price for such booking may not be altered.
You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post.
Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or
Renter's use of, a Space in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have
entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax
requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Space included in a Listing you
post, including, but not limited to, zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and
other properties and
(b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that SpaceCadet assumes no
responsibility for a Landlord’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations.
SpaceCadet reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable
access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that SpaceCadet, in its sole discretion,
considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful
to the Site, App or Services.
You understand and agree that SpaceCadet does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent
for you as a Landlord. If a Renter requests a booking of your Space and stores their items in or
uses your space, any agreement you enter into with such Renter is between you and the Renter
and SpaceCadet is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpaceCadet serves as
the limited authorized agent of the Landlord for the purpose of accepting payments from
Renters on behalf of the Landlord and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the
Landlord.
When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements and list
prohibited items which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of
your Space, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture,
connected Facebook account or other SNS account or verified phone number, or pay a security
deposit, in order to book your Space. Any Member wishing to book Space included in Listings
with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such
requirements is available via the applicable section of the Site, App and Services.
If you are a Landlord, SpaceCadet makes certain tools available to you to help you to make
informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for booking for your Space.
You acknowledge and agree that, as a Landlord, you are responsible for your own acts and
omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at
or are otherwise present at the Space at your request or invitation, excluding the Renter (and
the individuals the Renter invites to the Space, if applicable.)
VI. BOOKING AND FINANCIAL TERMS
1. LANDLORDS
If you are a Landlord and a booking is requested for your Space via the Site, App and Services,
you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 48 hours of when the
booking is requested (as determined by SpaceCadet in its sole discretion) or the booking
request will be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Site, App and
Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Renter who has requested the
booking, and (ii) a description of the items that the renter wishes to store, and (iii) the start and
end dates of the requested booking period (iiii) a link to the Renter's SpaceCadet Account
profile page. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Space within such
48 hour period, any amounts collected by SpaceCadet for the requested booking will be
refunded to the applicable Renter's credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card
will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Renter, SpaceCadet will send you
an email or text message or other method of notification confirming such booking, depending
on the selections you make via the Site, App and Services.
The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Space Fees (defined below) and the
Service Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Space
Fees and Space Fees. The Space Fees, the Service Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively
referred to in these Terms as the "Total Fees". The amounts due and payable by a Renter solely
relating to a Landlord’s Space are the "Space Fees". The Space fee is comprised of the
Landlord’s Rental Fee plus a fifteen(15) percent SpaceCadet Connection Charge. Please note
that it is the Landlord and not SpaceCadet, which determines the Rental Fee. The Rental Fee
may include a non-refundable cleaning fee or refundable security deposit at the Landlord's
discretion.
2. RENTERS
You agree to pay SpaceCadet for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with
your SpaceCadet Account if the applicable Landlord confirms such requested bookings. In order
to establish a booking pending the applicable Landlord's confirmation of your requested
booking, you understand and agree that SpaceCadet, on behalf of the Landlord, reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total
Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), to verify
your credit card. Once SpaceCadet receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable
Landlord, SpaceCadet will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing
terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that SpaceCadet cannot control any fees
that may be charged to a Renter by his or her bank related to SpaceCadet’s collection of the
Total Fees, and SpaceCadet disclaims all liability in this regard.
In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing
information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to SpaceCadet or
its third party payment processor. You agree to pay SpaceCadet for any confirmed bookings
made in connection with your SpaceCadet Account in accordance with these Terms by one of
the methods described on the Site, App or Services. You hereby authorize the collection of such
amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly
by SpaceCadet or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the
payment methods described on the Site or App. You also authorize SpaceCadet to charge your
credit card in the event of damage caused at a Space as contemplated under "Damage to
Space" below, if applicable. If you are directed to SpaceCadet's third party payment processor,
you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that
third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions
and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is
complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.
You acknowledge and agree that you, and not SpaceCadet, will be responsible for performing
the obligations of any such agreements, that SpaceCadet is not a party to such agreements, and
that, with the exception of its payment obligations above, SpaceCadet disclaims all liability
arising from or related to any such agreements.
3. RENTER ACCESS TO SPACE
In the listing the Landlord will provide the times that the Renter may access Stored Items. In
some cases, Landlord may provide Renter with means for unlimited Access. Renter must
contact Landlord at least 24 hours in advance to request Access unless otherwise specified in
rental agreement.
4. SPACE MOVE-OUT DUTIES
At or before the end of the booking period for the Space, Renter must vacate the Space
completely. Renter must remove all contents and debris. Renter must leave the Space in good
“broom clean” condition.
5. FEES
SpaceCadet charges a fee to Renter based upon a percentage of applicable Space Fees, which
are referred to herein as "Service Fees". The standard Service Fee charged by SpaceCadet is five
(5) percent of the applicable Space Fee. The Service Fees are added to the Space Fees to
calculate the Total Fees. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
If the booking period is one (1) month or less, SpaceCadet will collect from Renter the Total
Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Landlord confirms the booking within
48 hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Space Fees to the Landlord
after the booking period is over. Additional fees may be charged for Renter’s delayed removal
of stored items. If the booking period exceeds one (1) month, or if the one month rental period
is extended (by agreement between Renter and Landlord, or by Renter’s failure to remove
stored items), Renters will be charged monthly total fees on a recurring basis. SpaceCadet will
collect Total Fees and initiate payment of Space Fees to Landlord within five (5) business days
of the payment collection each month, referred to herein as Recurring Payments. If Recurring
Payments apply to your payment obligations for Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking, you
authorize SpaceCadet, on behalf of the Landlord, to collect the Total Fees in the increments and
at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, identified on the Site, App
and Services. Recurring Payments made after the 5th of the month will be assessed a $10 Late
Fee. There will be a dollar per day charge until payment is completed, up to $30, and will be
posted after the 15th and 25th of the month. If Landlord and Renter agree to a booking period
of less than one month, or an extension for a partial month, SpaceCadet shall collect Total Fees
and initiate payment of Space Fees on the basis of the pro rata portion of the monthly Fees, or
as the rental agreement may otherwise specify for shorter terms.
6. CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS
If, as a Renter, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed
by a Landlord, SpaceCadet will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund
any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking
within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Renter or host, you wish to cancel a confirmed
booking made via the Site, App and Services, prior to one (1) week before the confirmed
booking start date, then no penalties will occur. If a Landlord needs to cancel less than one (1)
week prior to the confirmed booking start date, then the Landlord will receive a Warning.
Multiple Warnings may lead to Landlord being banned from the Site, App and Services at the
sole discretion of SpaceCadet.
If a Landlord must cancel a confirmed booking after the booking period has already begun, the
Renter will receive a full refund from the Landlord, less any booking fees, for the entire month
leading up to the date of cancellation. Both Landlords and Renters may cancel any time during a
booking if either party feels uncomfortable, however repeat cancellations may reflect poorly on
user ratings.
Any request for a refund of the Space Fees and other amounts charged to you shall be subject
to SpaceCadet’s cancellation policy as set forth below.
If a Landlord cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, App and Services, (i) SpaceCadet
will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Renter within a commercially
reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Renter will receive an email or other
communication from SpaceCadet containing alternative Listings and other related information.
If the Renter requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Landlord
associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Renter's requested booking, then the
Renter agrees to pay SpaceCadet the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Space
in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If as a Landlord, you must cancel a
confirmed booking, please contact SpaceCadet at Hello@SpaceCadet.io. If a Landlord cancelled
a confirmed booking and you, as a Renter, have not received an email or other communication
from SpaceCadet, please contact SpaceCadet at Hello@SpaceCadet.io.
7. TAXES
IRS regulation, regarding federal tax reporting requirements, stipulates that SpaceCadet must
distribute IRS Form W-9 to all Landlords receiving payment via SpaceCadet. You understand and
agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting
requirements in consultation with your tax advisors. SpaceCadet cannot and does not offer
Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site, App and Services. Additionally, please note that
each Landlord is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any
applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings.
VII. SPACECADET RENTER INSURANCE
SpaceCadet recommends that Renters check their homeowners or renters insurance, if they
have it, because standard policies will usually cover you for theft, loss or damage to your
personal property even when stored elsewhere. If you don’t have such coverage, and are
concerned about loss of your property, SpaceCadet recommends that you purchase such
coverage.
1. THEFT PROTECTION
SpaceCadet protects Renters from the risk of theft in several limited ways. First, in the event of
loss of your property due to a burglary or theft of your goods, contact SpaceCadet immediately
and we will assist you in determining the proper course of action. Second, SpaceCadet verifies
SNS and contact information of Landlord and Renter. Third, Landlords and Renters rate and
review each other, and if a complaint is lodged, SpaceCadet reserves rights to terminate
membership, in its sole discretion, or to furnish such information to other shared service
businesses.
VIII. PROTECTION FOR LANDLORD’S PROPERTY
SpaceCadet recommends that Landlords check their insurance policies or speak to their agents
to verify that their coverage includes damage to Landlord’s property caused by an invited guest
(such as a Renter) entering or exiting the Landlord’s Space, or otherwise caused by the property
being stored. If such coverage is not afforded by your policy, or if Landlord seeks additional
protection, SpaceCadet recommends that Landlords charge a security deposit, as provided in
the rental agreement set forth in the Site, App and Services.
IX. NO ENDORSEMENT
SpaceCadet does not endorse any Members or any Space. You are responsible for determining
the suitability of others who you contact or contact you via the Site, App and Services.
SpaceCadet will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions
with other Members.
By using the Site, App or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to
obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a
claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you
agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from SpaceCadet with
respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly
with other Members on the Site, App and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by
you.
X. USE OF SPACE AND PROHIBITED ITEMS
RENTER AGREES NOT TO USE THE SPACE FOR ANY UNLAWFUL PURPOSE. THE SPACE IS TO BE
USED BY RENTER ONLY FOR STORAGE OF PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY. USE OF THE
SPACE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN FOR LAWFUL STORAGE OF PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS, SUCH AS USE OF THE SPACE FOR DRUG USE OR SEXUAL ACTIVITY IS EXPRESSLY
PROHIBITED. STORAGE OF EXPLOSIVES, FUEL, HAZARDOUS OR FLAMMABLE MATERIALS,
PESTICIDES OR OTHER TOXIC CHEMICALS, WASTE OF ANY KIND, FIREARMS, AMMUNITION,
ILLEGAL DRUGS OR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES, STOLEN GOODS OR OTHER
CONTRABAND, SPOILED FOOD, LIVING OR DECEASED ANIMALS, INFESTED ITEMS, MOLDY ITEMS
OR ANY OTHER ITEMS SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED BY THE LANDLORD ON THE LISTING IS
EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.
Upon breach, or Landlord's reasonable suspicion of breach, of these terms, the Renter agrees
that the Landlord has the right to immediately terminate the booking agreement and to ask
Renter to remove the items from the Landlord’s premises. Landlord shall provide reasonable
notice and opportunity for Renter to cure such breach or otherwise remove such items. If
Renter does not remove such items upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, such
items may be removed by Landlord and shall be subject to forfeiture by Renter. Landlord may
also contact Law Enforcement or other authorities to report illegal activities of Renter. If
Landlord reasonably suspects the storage of items in breach of the above prohibitions, or other
illegal activities, the Renter hereby agrees to give permission for authorities to search the
stored items without a warrant. Renter agrees to release, indemnify, and hold Landlord
harmless from and against any and all liability arising from or relating to the removal or
forfeiture of stored property, or the Renter’s breach of this provision, including any allegations
or investigations relating thereto. Renter shall forfeit all rent and Service Fees paid up the date
of termination hereunder.
XI. RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY DUE TO LANDLORD’S NEGLIGENCE
Renter agrees that the use of the Space is at Renter's sole risk. Renter agrees that, without
limiting any duties of the Landlord to take reasonable steps to protect Renter’s property,
Landlord shall have no liability to Renter or Renter's invitees for any personal or bodily injury
except in the event of Landlord’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Renter hereby waives
and disclaims any and all claims or causes of action Renter may have against Landlord, in the
event of personal or bodily injury to Renter or Renter’s invitees, except as a result of Landlord’s
gross negligence or willful misconduct.
XII. RULES
Renter, Renter's employees, agent, family, guests and other invitees must comply with
Landlord's rules and policies and with any other rules contained in the Listing or in any
correspondence or other written communication between Landlord and Renter, be it through
SpaceCadet’s messaging system, email or exchanged between the Landlord and Renter at the
time of leasing or mailed or hand-delivered to Renter at any time.
XIII. DEFAULT BY RENTER
Renter will be in "default" if: (a) Renter has failed to pay any sum when due under the Listing,
or (b) Renter has failed to notify Landlord of a change in Renter's address or phone number as
required in these terms; or (c) Renter has provided false or incorrect information to Landlord or
in any mailing address changes submitted to Landlord; or (d) Renter has failed to comply with
any other provision of these Terms, or any supplemental rules in the Listing or provided by
Landlord; or (e) Renter has violated health, safety or criminal laws on the Landlord's property,
regardless of whether arrest or conviction has occurred. Failure of SpaceCadet or Landlord to
enforce any of these Terms shall not constitute waiver of such Term(s).
XIV. LANDLORD’S REMEDY
If Renter is in "default," Landlord shall take reasonable steps to notify Renter of such default,
and provide Renter a reasonable opportunity to cure such default. If Renter fails to cure such
default, after receiving such notice and opportunity to cure, Landlord may exercise one or more
of the following remedies:
(a) Deny Renter access to the Space or Renter's property until default is cured;
(b) Terminate Renter's Booking by giving Renter three (3) days' notice to vacate; and if Renter
fails to vacate and Landlord files an eviction lawsuit, Renter will pay Landlord's attorneys' fees
and court costs plus a reasonable judicial eviction charge for Landlord's time, inconvenience
and overhead for filing the eviction suit;
(c) Collect charges as appropriate and exercise any other remedy allowed by law; and/or
(d) Enforce Landlord's lien by seizure and sale of all contents in the Space by nonjudicial
foreclosure under the Landlord's local and state codes.
Seizure and sale will only be for default in paying sums due to Landlord. Landlord may accept
partial payments but only payments in full, including applicable fees, will stop a lien sale.
(e) After seizure, any attempt to reclaim the seized property by Renter without paying in full
the sums due Landlord, including applicable fees, may result in Landlord pursuing prosecution
for such act.
